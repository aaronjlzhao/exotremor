# Project Overview
ExoTremor is an affordable, 3D-printed, wearable assistive device designed to help individuals with hand tremors, such as those caused by movement disorders, perform daily tasks with greater stability. The project was inspired by the creator's personal experience with shaky hands, which made precision tasks challenging, and a desire to address the lack of accessible solutions for people in developing countries. ExoTremor aims to provide a cost-effective alternative to expensive medical technologies, enabling users to regain control over tasks like picking up a cup or aligning a screwdriver.
The project is in its early stages, with a prototype focused on stabilizing wrist flexion-extension movements. Initial experiments have shown promising results in reducing tremor amplitude, and we are now inviting interested parties to participate in beta testing or explore partnership opportunities to help refine the design, expand its capabilities, and conduct further testing.

# Features
- Wearable device to stabilize hand and wrist movements
- Support for various tremor types and severities
- Integration with a diagnostic tool for tremor monitoring and analysis
- Customizable settings tailored to individual user needs
- Proprietary technology for enhanced stabilization and control

# Experimental Design
Phase 1 of testing, known as the Isolated Flexion-Extension Test, was conducted to evaluate the ExoTremor prototype's effectiveness:
- Tremor Simulation: Simulated 5 Hz (300 bpm) flexion-extension tremors using headphones and a metronome to guide hand movements.
- Wrist Isolation: Fixed the forearm with the ExoTremor device to a flat surface to isolate wrist tremors, minimizing interference from other variables like forearm motion.
- Data Collection: Recorded tremor waveforms and amplitude using the Gyroscope Diagnostic Tool while the user held one of three objects: a pen, a light hot sauce bottle, or a medium seed. Each test ran for 15 seconds.
- Comparison: Repeated the process with the ExoTremor device activated to measure its impact on tremor reduction.

# Results
Initial testing demonstrated a noticeable reduction in tremor amplitude when the ExoTremor was activated. Specific reduction percentages for the tested objects (pen, light hot sauce bottle, medium seed) are pending full data analysis and will be updated here once available.
How It Works
ExoTremor is a wearable device worn on the forearm and wrist, designed to counteract involuntary hand movements. The current prototype targets flexion-extension tremors, with plans to address additional tremor types in future iterations. The proprietary stabilization technology enhances precision and control during everyday tasks.
The Gyroscope Diagnostic Tool is a companion software that interfaces with the device's sensors to record and analyze tremor data. It provides users and researchers with insights into tremor patterns and the device's performance.

# Usage
- Attach the Device: Secure the ExoTremor to your forearm and wrist.
- Activate: Turn on the stabilization feature.
- Perform Tasks: Engage in activities like writing, holding objects, or pouring liquids with improved stability.
- Monitor: Use the Gyroscope Diagnostic Tool to track tremor patterns and adjust the device as needed.
